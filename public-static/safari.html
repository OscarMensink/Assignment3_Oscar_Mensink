      <h2>Safari Origin</h2>
      <p>
        On January 7, 2003, at Macworld San Francisco, Steve Jobs announced that
        Apple had developed its own web browser, called Safari. It was based on
        Apple's internal fork of the KHTML rendering engine, called WebKit. The
        company released the first beta version, available only for Mac OS X,
        later that day. A number of official and unofficial beta versions
        followed, up until version 1.0 was released on June 23, 2003.[12]
        Initially only available as a separate download for Mac OS X 10.2,
        Safari was bundled with Mac OS X v10.3 on October 24, 2003, as the
        default browser, with Internet Explorer for Mac included only as an
        alternative browser. Version 1.0.3, released on August 13, 2004, was the
        last version to support Mac OS X 10.2, while 1.3.2, released on January
        12, 2006, was the last version to support Mac OS X 10.3. However, 10.3
        received security updates through 2007.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was Safari 1. Since then there have been 14 versions. Each
        including its own updates and improvments. Below you can read about a
        few tricks a tips the current Safari has.

      <h2>Safari tricks and tips</h2>
      <h3>Cusomizable tool bar</h3>
      <p>
        Having a functional toolbar with the buttons you use most is key to
        using Safari. If you never use the Home button, for instance, you can
        remove it. And if you want a button for the Sidebar, you can add it.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make changes, right-click on the toolbar and select Customize
        Toolbar. Then drag the buttons you want from the popup window into the
        toolbar or those you don't want from the toolbar to the window. You can
        also arrange the buttons as you like. Click Done when you finish.
      </p>
      <h3>Picture-in-Picture</h3>
      <p>
        Picture-in-Picture was one of the best new parts of Safari that arrived
        with macOS Sierra. Being able to watch a video that's floating over
        everything else is really useful. It works on a lot of popular video
        streaming sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        On sites like Vimeo, you'll find the Enter Picture-in-Picture button in
        the bottom toolbar. But on YouTube, right-click and then right-click
        again to open the shortcut menu. From there, select Enter
        Picture-in-Picture.
      </p>
      <h3>Turn Off Notification Popups</h3>
      <p>
        If you visit a lot of blogs or news sites, you may see a prompt to
        subscribe to new posts. Rather than denying the request every single
        time, you can disable this feature altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
        Click Safari > Preferences from the menu bar and select the Websites
        tab. On the left, click Notifications. Then, at the bottom, uncheck the
        option for Allow websites to ask for permission to send notifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also click the dropdown box to the right of any website in your
        list to Deny or Allow notifications for particular sites.
      </p>
      <h3>Enable URL Previews in Status Bar</h3>
      <p>
        You can see the URL of a link in the status bar while you hover over it
        with your cursor. Click on View from the menu bar and select Show Status
        Bar and you're set. This is a handy security function, as it allows you
        to double-check that links actually go to where they claim.
      </p>
      <h3>Save pages as PDFs</h3>
      <p>
        Exporting a web page as a PDF doesn't require a special extension when
        you use Safari. Visit the page and click File > Export as PDF.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, just choose where you want to save the page and hit Save to
        export.

      <h2>Mozilla Firefox Origin</h2>
      <p class="chrome-page">
        Mozilla Firefox is a free and open-source webbrowser which was developed
        by the Mozilla-Project. Nowadays Mozilla is not used as widely as
        before, but the browser is still very popular with webdevelopers because
        it follows W3C web standards better than most other browsers. Also ther
        are a lot of very usefull extension avalible for Firefox. In January
        2015 there were a total of 18.000 ad-ons.

      <h2>Mozilla Firefox Tips and Tricks</h2>
      <h3>More Screen Space</h3>
      <p>
        Firefox allows you to reduce the size of the icons and your toolbar. It
        is only a small change, but it can save some much needed screenspace on
        a tablet, or just give a more minmalistic look.
      </p>
      <h3>Quick Bookmarking</h3>
      <p>
        With one click you can bookmark any webpage that you are currently on.
        By simply clicking the star icon on the right of the toolbar, Firefox
        save a bookmark of the specific website your are on, so you can acces it
        easily any time you want.
      </p>
      <h3>Personalized Toolbar</h3>
      <p>
        In firefox you can personlize your toolbar and add any icons you need.
        This allows you to print, download share or do anything you need on a
        webpage with just one click.
      </p>
      <h3>Set Up Multiple Homepages</h3>
      <p>
        Firefox also alows you to set up multiple homepages. So if you can't
        chose which websites need to open when you first launch your browser,
        Firefox can just open all of them for you at once.
      </p>
      <h3>Password Vault Lockwise</h3>
      <p>
        Firefox can store all your passwords safely and secure in their vault
        called Lockwise, so that you don't have to remeber every password on
        every website, or have the same password for many websites, which of
        course, is never a good idea. All you have to do, is think of one master
        password, and this allows you to acces your vault. Firefox will
        automaticly fill in any details that are saved for that specific
        website.
      </p>
      <h3>Increase the speed</h3>
      <p>
        If you feel Firefox is running a bit slow, you can give it some extra
        power by turning on hardware acceleration. Just go to
        <b>About: Preferences > General > Performance</b> and uncheck the box
        that says: <b>Use Recommended Performance Settings</b>. A new checkbox
        should appear that says <b>Use hardware acceleration when available</b>,
        just check the box, and it should give your browser some extra power if
        avalible.
      </p>
      <h3>Screen Grab</h3>
      <p>
        This feature currently is integrated in most opertaing systems already
        but it's still a nice feature to have. Firefox allows you to very easily
        take screenshot or partial screenshots of a webpage and allows you to
        store them instantly. You can make a screenshot by right clicking
        anywher on a page, and clicking the <b>Page Actions menu</b>. Now just
        select the area you need a screenshot from, and you're done!

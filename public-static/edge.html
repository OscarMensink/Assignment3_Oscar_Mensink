      <h2>Microsoft Edge Origin</h2>
      <p>
        Microsoft Edge is a cross-platform web browser that was first released
        in 2015 as a succesor of the not so liked Internet Explorer. Since then
        however, many changes were made to Edge. In June 2020 a new Chromium
        based version of Microsoft Edge was realeased. Chromium is an opensource
        webbrowser which is also the base of Google Chrome. This is why Edge and
        Chrome feel very similair.

      <h2>Microsoft Edge Tips and Tricks</h2>
      <h3>Annotate a webpage</h3>
      <p>
        Edge allows you to draw and highlight anything on a webpage and save a
        screenshot which allows you to easily make notes when doing research.
      </p>
      <h3>Dark Theme</h3>
      <p>
        If we are browsing late in the evening, you don't want a bright light
        shining in your eyes. That's why Edge, like most browsers nowadays,
        allows you to select a dark theme which makes most websites a lot less
        bright and more pleasing to your eyes.
      </p>
      <h3>Personalized Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Edge also allows you to build a personalized homepage, which opens when
        by default when you start up your browser. Here you set shortcuts to
        websites you often visit, which can save a bit of much needed time.
      </p>
      <h3>Cortana</h3>
      <p>
        Microsofts visual assistant Cortana is also integrated into Microsoft
        Edge. Cortana is like a personal secretary. Cortana can send you
        reminders of events saved on your calender or help you search the web
        through the cortana search bar. Also, because Edge and Cortana are both
        products made by Microsft, Cortana allows you to open apps on your pc
        from Edge withouth having to leave your browser. If you'd like to learn
        more about cortana,
        <a
          href="https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/turn-use-cortana-microsoft-edge"
          >here are some cool tips</a
        >
      </p>
      <h3>Save Content to your Collecitons</h3>
      <p>
        Edge allows you to save webcontent from any page to your Collecitons
        which are located at the top right of the browser. This way you can
        easily store and find any content you find, and need to use at a later
        time.
      </p>
      <h3>Extensions</h3>
      <p>
        Because Edge is Chromium based, all extension that work on Chrome also
        work on Microsoft Edge. This way, if you want to switch from Chrome to
        Edge, you can take all you extensions with you.
      </p>
      <h3>Mute Tabs Individually</h3>
      <p>
        Antother great simple but great thing about Edge, is that you can mute
        tabs individually simply by right clicking the specific tab, and click
        mute. By muting individually, I mean that if I mute a tab with
        youtube.com open, another tab with youtube will still be able to play.
        On other browsers, like Chrome this is not the case, there you can only
        mute a specific website, which mutes all tabs that have that website
        open.
